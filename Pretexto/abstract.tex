\chapter{Abstract}

In this thesis, the mass of the tau lepton is determined by comparing three methods for decays with semi-invisible final states.
The measurement was performed for the decay \(\tau \rightarrow \pi \nu \) (signal). It is obtained that the best result was provided by the method \(M_{min}\) for a mass of the tau lepton of \(m _{\tau} = 1777.06 \pm 0.44\) MeV. The measurement was completed using official Monte Carlo data from the Belle II collaboration in the MC13a campaign ended in 2020.
